== Theming and Branding with Kinetic Request
Kinetic Request allows you to completely customize the look and feel of your 
service catalog, forms, and other consoles.  Since Kinetic Request is a Java 
web application, accessed by a web browser (such as Internet Explorer, Firefox,
Safari, or Chrome), specifying the overall look and feel is accomplished using
standard and well established web development technologies: HTML, CSS, 
Javascript, and a little bit of Java.

A Bundle is a self contained collection of files intended to simplify the 
improvement of web-based Kinetic Request interfaces. These files are stored 
with the Kinetic Request web application, and help to define both interface 
architecture (such as how to retrieve dynamic Kinetic Request information) 
and the interface look and feel. The Kinetic Bundle strategy leverages common 
web technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript) together with JSP to implement a 
fully brandable service interface.  A Bundle represents a consistent web 
presence or identity for the Kinetic Request application, and allows a single 
Kinetic Request installation to serve multiple themes and brands.
